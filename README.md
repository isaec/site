# statistics
Statistics are rebuilt on the hour by a github action, and hosted on github. See [isaec/isaec](https://github.com/isaec/isaec) for the details. [lowlighter/metrics](https://github.com/lowlighter/metrics) generates the svg.

# masonry
The masonry is achieved with a responsive css grid, which contains vertical and horizontal groups - which are also capable of collapsing. Check the css for more details.
